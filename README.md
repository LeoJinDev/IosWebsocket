starscream
==========

WebSocket [RFC 6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) client library in swift for iOS and OSX.

starscream conforms to all of the base [Autobahn test suite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/). The library is very simple and only a few hundred lines of code, but fully featured. It runs completely on a background thread, so processing will never block the main thread. 

starscream also has a Objective-C counter part here: [jetfire](https://github.com/acmacalister/jetfire)

## Example ##

```
Coming shortly....
```

## Requirements ##

starscream requires at least iOS 7/OSX 10.10 or above.


## License ##

starscream is license under the Apache License.
